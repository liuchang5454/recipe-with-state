## A simple react app with state

- Built with create-react-app. 
- Comes with a Navbar and 3 Recipe cards
- Each recipe card has an image, title, ingredients and cooking instructions
- You can add new recipe by clicking "New Recipe" link on navbar, new recipe form is hidden by default
- You can delete recipe card
- Praticed with concepts of State, Props and PropTypes. 

Pay Attention to:
- Both RecipeApp and RecipeInput components have state: each component's state is like an additional water source that joins the waterfall that flows down, that only affects components “below” them.
